<p>
<h3> Top Gun Maverick</h3>
<p>I loved the 3D effect within the movie. What's even more interesting is the comeback hero played by Tom cruise. Absolutely worth the hype!</p>
<h3>Loki</h3>
<p> If you're a sucker for Marvel, then this is a must watch. The ending is jawdropping</p>
<h3>Halo</h3>
<p>The best movie for all the gamers out there.It's based off of the Halo PC game.</p>
